## Learning Objectives

### Core iOS Fundamentals
1. iOS Architecture Patterns - MVVM, Coordinator pattern for navigation and separation of concerns
2. Reactive Programming - RxSwift for data binding, event handling, and asynchronous operations
3. Memory Management - ARC, weak/unowned references, retain cycles, and leak prevention
4. Networking & APIs - Alamofire, URLSession, JSON decoding, and API integration

### Advanced Concepts
5. Concurrency & Threading - GCD, DispatchQueues, async/await, main thread vs background threads
6. Mobile System Design - Architecture design, flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and scalability patterns
7. Swift Language Features - Protocols, delegation, higher-order functions, generics, and closures
8. iOS UI Components - UITableView, UICollectionView, UIImageView, custom views, and Auto Layout

### Cloud & Modern Technologies
9. Firebase Integration - Authentication, Cloud Firestore, real-time data sync, and security rules
10. iOS App Lifecycle - Scene delegates, app states, background tasks, and state restoration
